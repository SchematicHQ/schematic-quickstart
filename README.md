# Schematic React SDK Playground

This is a quickstart playground to demonstrate [Schematic](https://www.schematichq.com/) and it's core features. This quickstart is built to sync with our [quickstart docs](https://docs.schematichq.com/quickstart/overview). To use this quickstart, you'll need a Schematic account ((signup for free)[https://app.schematichq.com/sign-up]).

You can see a hosted and fully configured version [here](https://schematic-demo-hosted-schematichq.vercel.app/entitlements).

## What's Inside

Pre-built samples for the following core features:

- Feature flags and feature gating
